# luau-mode-setter

The Luau Mode Setter extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to easily toggle different mode directives in .luau files used in Roblox development. With this extension, you can quickly set strict mode for your .luau script:

## Features

Toggle Modes: Quickly switch between different modes (strict, nonstrict, nocheck) for individual .luau files or entire directories.

## How to use
- The plugin auto activates when .luau file is found

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Known Issues

- The extension will be activated automatically when .luau file existed in workspace. This also disabled automatically if no .luau files found (e.g when you delete all .luau file from the project)
- However, after you delete all files, the extension cannot re-activated. You must restart vscode to activate it again.
